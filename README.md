# Lockra1n v2.0 Beta 3 Update
Lockra1n v2.0 Beta 3 has some major changes to the first beta. Some notable ones are:

Swift Re-write: This app was originally coded in Python, but I did a complete re-write in Swift. This makes Lockra1n a ton more stable then the previous version.

Device Registration: Another update is device registration. You will have to register your Apple device serial number on my website. This is only once per device.
Follow this link to register your device: https://alwaysappleftd.com/software/Lockra1n/register_device.php

iOS 15 Ramdisk loading issue fixed: Lockra1n can now bypass iOS 15 untethered. In the previous beta, there was a ramdisk loading problem which for some reason prevented the activation records from actually working with the device. This issue is now fixed.

PLEASE NOTE: This app is still in its early stages. Please don’t get upset of there are some bugs.
While I have done excessive testing on my devices, the software isn't finalized yet. 
Kindly report any bugs to me as I aim to make the software the best it can be. 
You can message me on X (Twitter) @AlwaysAppleFTD, Instagram @finn.desilva or email alwaysappleftd@icloud.com. Thank you for your participation in this new software!

# How to Download Lockra1n

Visit the Lockra1n page on my website at: https://alwaysappleftd.com/software/Lockra1n.html for details.

Once on the site, click the blue download button in the How to Download Lockra1n section of the page to open the file link. 
From there, once the file sharing site opens, click the blue download button on MediaFire to start the download.

NOTE: If you see a message that the app cannot be opened because it's from an unidentified developer, just right-click on the app file and select "Open." This will bypass the unidentified developer message and open the app.

If the app still won’t open, follow these steps:

Open a blank Terminal window. You can find the Terminal app in the Other folder in your Launchpad.
Type, in lowercase, xattr -cr (without quotes), then drag and drop the Lockra1n application you downloaded into the Terminal window.
Press Enter to run the command.
These steps should allow the app to open. If you encounter any further launching issues, please contact me.

# How to Use Lockra1n

Open the app you downloaded from here.

If you see the "Untrusted Developer" message, follow the steps above to resolve it.
For any other launching issues, please contact me.
Click the "Setup Lockra1n" button to ensure everything is installed and ready for using Lockra1n.

1. Click the "Search for Device" button. This will pair your device with the computer. Make sure to hit "Trust" on the device if prompted!

2. Click the "Generate Activation Files" button. It will check the registration and generate activation tickets for your device.

If you are not registered, the tool will prompt you to do so. You can visit the free registration page here: https://alwaysappleftd.com/software/Lockra1n/register_device.php
If you encounter an error like "Failed to generate tickets!", DO NOT ATTEMPT to activate! This could brick your device, requiring a restore in most cases to fix.

3. Click the "Bypass Device!" button.

Here, you have two options. You can stay in Normal mode (which is usual in most cases), or if you have already entered DFU Mode, the tool will detect your device in DFU Mode or Recovery.
Ultimately, you will always need to enter DFU Mode on your device. The method varies depending on your device.
I recommend searching "How to Enter DFU Mode on [your device model]." For example, "How to Enter DFU Mode on iPhone 8."
The tool will mount the device’s filesystem, inject the tickets, apply some filesystem modifications, and reboot your device. After your device turns back on, you will be on the Home Screen!

Once everything is done, your device is bypassed untethered!

Enjoy bypassing your devices using this software!
As mentioned above, report any bugs you encounter back to me.

Thank you for your participation in this new software!
