# Lockra1n

This is an iCloud bypass tool that I coded in Python. To run this app, just double-click on the Lockra1n app file. 
The app should open up! 

How to use Lockra1n: 
[2] Press the "Install Dependencies" button. This will make sure everything is ready to use with Lockra1n.
[2] Press the "Connect Device" button. Make sure you have connected your iCloud locked device to the computer. This will pair your device with the computer.
[3] Press the "Generate Activation Files" button. This generates the activation tickets for your device.
[4] Press the "Bypass Device!" button and follow the steps in the tool. Start with your device in normal mode, then Enter DFU Mode when the tool asks you to. Then, the tool will boot the ramdisk and bypass the device.

NOTE: You don't need to use the "Jailbreak the device" button. This function now built into the bypass function. Lockra1n used to bypass devices via normal mode, but now it bypasses your device via the ramdisk so a jailbreak is no longer needed.

I hope you have fun unlocking your devices.
Enjoy!
