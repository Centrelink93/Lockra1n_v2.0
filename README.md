# Lockra1n

Please note: I was not able to upload the app file directly onto this repository because GitHub doesnâ€™t allow files bigger than 25 MB to be directly uploaded. Please see the Releases section for a full download. You can click on the tag from the Releases pane, and then select "Lockra1n".
I will be uploading an alternative link soon for MediaFire.

This is an iCloud bypass tool that I coded in Python. To run this app, just double-click on the Lockra1n app file. 
The app should open up! 

How to use Lockra1n: 

VERY IMPORTANT! This is a beta. Do not get upset if it doesn't function perfectly, I am still working on it. Once I feel I have got the app to a manageable state, then I will officially release it on my website. Please be patient. For now, it will be on GitHub and MediaFire only.

[1] Press the "Install Dependencies" button. This will make sure everything is ready to use with Lockra1n. NOTE: You only need to do this once. I would not recommend doing this more than once.

[2] Press the "Connect Device" button. Make sure you have connected your iCloud locked device to the computer. This will pair your device with the computer.

[3] Press the "Generate Activation Files" button. This generates the activation tickets for your device.
IF you see any kind of warning or error, then DO NOT CONTINUE!! This could cause your device to be bricked, forcing you to restore the device with iTunes or Finder.

[4] Press the "Bypass Device!" button and follow the steps in the tool. Start with your device in normal mode, then enter DFU Mode when the tool asks you to. Then, the tool will boot the ramdisk and bypass the device.

NOTE: You don't need to use the "Jailbreak the device" button. This function now built into the bypass function. Lockra1n used to bypass devices via normal mode, but now it bypasses your device via the ramdisk so a jailbreak is no longer needed.

I hope you have fun unlocking your devices.
Enjoy!
